As the seventh election held since the country's re-establishment of democracy in 1999, the current presidential election was momentous. Three contenders emerged as frontrunners among the 18 seeking for the position of the president of the Federal Republic of Nigeria: Atiku Abubakar, Peter Obi, and Bola Tinubu. Throughout the campaign, the economic and national security of Nigeria took center stage, with voters concerned about rising costs of livingÂ and the occurrence of violent crimes. Bola Tinubu was ultimately victorious amidst several controversies. The voyage, however, did not end there, as the opposition parties quickly launched legal suits aiming to question the poll's legitimacy and demand a new election.
